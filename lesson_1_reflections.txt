How did viewing a diff/fc between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Much easier than comparing by hand. Shows the differences made between the two files so can 
catch errors made from a non-working one to a working one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer
in the long term?
Can see previous versions, if a change is made, and don't like the change or causes an error, can
easily go back to a previous workign version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in 
Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Automatically is good if you forget, the more manual is better for more logical breaks.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git because code is interlinked, google docs, usually each doc is not related to another. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
log to see previous commits. diff to see which lines were changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you can go back to a previous unbroken version.

git init - create repository
git log
git diff
git status

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
